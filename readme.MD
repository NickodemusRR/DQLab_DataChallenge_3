# DQ Lab Internal Data Challenge 3

This data challenge is about data engineering. This is new field for me so I try to follow the instruction that was given in 'Data Engineer - Beginner Task v1'

The normalized dataset is [dataset.csv](Data/dataset.csv).

The code to get data, join tables, and dump new data is in [the notebook](DQLab_Data_Challenge_3.ipynb).
